lipsum.sh
=========

Shell (bash) script for generating *lorem ipsum* placeholder text. The
generated text is based on the standard lorem ipsum passage and the sections
1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero (see
[lipsum.com](https://lipsum.com/) for further details).

The `lipsum.sh` script generates multiple paragraphs of placeholder text
assembled randomly. Almost: the first paragraph is always the standard lorem
ipsum paragraph. You will only need this script.

The script `utils.sh` contains some simple functions helping to get the word
and sentence count, etc. of the original pieces of text.
